Unit 6 Giphy API 
This is my first ReadMe...
The app created using a Giphy API
The app has buttons created for different vaction destinations
You are able to enter a new city or country into the search bar
Pushing the "Generate Destination" Button will add that destination
Click on any destination button
10 different gifs will appear on the page
each will have its "Rating" displayed
Don't worry, your eyes aren't playing tricks on you.
The gifs are not moving when they load. 
Click on a gif individually to animate it. 
Click it once again to make it still.

Enjoy!
